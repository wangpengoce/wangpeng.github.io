![Peng](/img/Peng_Wang.png)

I graduated from the [Ocean University of China](http://www.ouc.edu.cn) in 2011 with the B.S. in Ocean Sciences; then I came to United States to study at [University of Miami](http://www.miami.edu) (<a href="http://www.rsmas.miami.edu" target="_blank">RSMAS</a> campus), and graduated in 2016 with Ph.D. in Meteorology and Physical Oceanography. Currently, I am a postdoc at the University of Miami.
